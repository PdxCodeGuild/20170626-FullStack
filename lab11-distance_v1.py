# lab 11 v1: convert the given distance and units to meters

# 1) get the distance from the user
# 2) convert that distance to a float
# 3) get the units from the user
# 4) convert the distance to meters

# meters = 1609.34*miles
# meters = 0.3048*feet
# meters = 1000*km

# convert the given distance from the given units to meters
